# Firebase Realtime Database Synchronization Issue

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue encountered with Firebase Realtime Database, where data synchronization between clients is intermittently delayed. The problem is not consistently reproducible, making debugging challenging.  The `bug.js` file contains the code exhibiting the synchronization issue.  `bugSolution.js` offers potential solutions and workarounds.

**Problem:** Updates made on one client are not immediately reflected on other clients.  Delays can vary significantly.

**Possible Causes:**
* Network Connectivity Issues
* Firebase Server-Side Latency
* Client-Side Caching (though less likely)
* Race conditions in application code (rare, investigated)

**Solutions:**
See `bugSolution.js` for potential workarounds, which include incorporating error handling, implementing offline capabilities, and re-examining database rules.  Further investigation might be required depending on the specific nature of the delay.
