In a Firebase project, I've encountered an issue where data isn't syncing properly between the client and the database.  Specifically, when I update data on the client using Firebase's Realtime Database, the changes aren't reflected immediately on other clients or devices.  I've verified that the data is being sent to the database correctly, and there are no apparent errors in the console logs.  The issue is intermittent, and the delay in synchronization can range from a few seconds to several minutes.
