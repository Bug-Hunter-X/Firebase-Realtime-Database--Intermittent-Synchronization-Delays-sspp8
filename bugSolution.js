Several potential solutions exist for addressing the intermittent synchronization problem in Firebase Realtime Database. Here are a few approaches you can try:

1. **Robust Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling within your Firebase operations.  Catch any exceptions that might occur during data updates and handle them appropriately.

```javascript
database.ref().child('myData').set({ ... }).catch(error => {
  console.error('Error updating data:', error);
  // Retry logic or alternative handling
});
```

2. **Offline Capabilities:** Leverage Firebase's offline capabilities. This allows data changes to be stored locally until a connection is re-established, ensuring data consistency even with transient network issues.

```javascript
database.ref().onDisconnect().set({ status: 'offline' }); //Example
```

3. **Review Database Rules:** While you've stated they are correct, double-check your Firebase Realtime Database rules to ensure they are not inadvertently causing delays or restrictions on data access.

4. **Connection Monitoring:** Add monitoring for the database connection state. If the connection is lost, retry operations or inform the user.  Firebase provides mechanisms to detect connection changes.

5. **Data Versioning/Timestamps:**  Consider adding a timestamp or version number to your data. This can help identify stale or out-of-date data and provide a mechanism for conflict resolution if multiple updates happen simultaneously.

6. **Client-Side Caching (Rare):** Though less likely, ensure your application isn't caching data inappropriately. Make sure to utilize the Firebase methods correctly, rather than relying on local caching strategies.

7. **Asynchronous Operations:** Be mindful of asynchronous nature of Firebase. Use `.then()` and `.catch()` to ensure proper handling of asynchronous operations.
